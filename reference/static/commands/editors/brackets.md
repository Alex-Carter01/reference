## What's that?

#### Brackts is an editor developed by Adobe Systems and focused on web development.

It is currently maintained on GitHub, so there are a bunch of plugins that you can download/create to personalize it to your liking.

#### It supports auto completion for HTML and automatically indents.

Which is great! It basically means that it autocompletes divisions, closing them for you whenever you need it. Brackets also lets you download a plugin that indents everything for you everytime that you save the file; it helps make  your code more legible!

#### It works on macOS, Windows and Linux.

Have a Mac and a Windows? One or the other? Both? Or do you prefer Linux? Regardless, you can run Brackets on all of them! If you're working in a team with a variety of operating systems, every member can access all of the features that this editor provides.

#### It lets you see a live preview of your website.

Brackets has a little lightning-like button on the right side of the interface that lets you see a live preview of your website. It might not sound extremely helpful, but it is. It facilitates the process of switching back and forth between your code and how it actually looks, and lets you immediatly be able to see what you've written. It's basically instant gratification.


## Awesome Extensions:

#### Beautify

The program that automatically indents and corrects the indentations in your program.

#### Documents Toolbar

This extension adds a toolbar with tabs of the documents you have open at the top of the editor. It's great! With it, you don't have to worry about opening/closing files, and about having more than one window open at the same time.

#### Lion

Lion is a really cool dark theme that changes the colors of Brackets - it's gorgeous. If you don't like it though, that's fine! There's a bunch of other themes that you can download and add.
